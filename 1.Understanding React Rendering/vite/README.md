#Topics Covered
-This Project is to understand the React project structure provided by the vite bundler
-index.html is the main file which has only one element(having the id of root here)
-index.html has the main.jsx as its scripting file(in create-react-app this file is provided
 to index.html by "react-scripts" dependency
-the main.jsx imports the React as well as ReactDOM library and invokes the createRoot function using the
 element ie root in the index.html and renders the app.jsx component inside it
-the app.jsx contains all our code including the components to be displayed 

This setup provides you with a starting point for building a React application with Vite, leveraging Vite's
fast development server, HMR (Hot Module Replacement), and optimized build process.
